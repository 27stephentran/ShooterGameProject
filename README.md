# How I created this game.

I use the PyGame Library for the project.

I set the FPS to 60.

Created the GameSprite Class as the main class for the project.

Created the Player, Enemy inherite from GameSprite Class to seperate the sprite.

Created the Bullet from GameSprite to make the bullet for the spaceship.

To controll your spaceship you will need to use A and D to control to fire the bullet use Spacebar.
